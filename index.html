        <li>
          <strong>November 30, 1863</strong>
           - Andres Bonifacio was born in Tondo, Manila, the eldest among six siblings. He studied under Guillermo Osmeña from Cebu. To make a living, he, along with his siblings, sold sticks and fans. He worked as a clerk-messenger at Fleming and Co. and Fressel and Co. Dr. Milagros Guerrero considered him a young urban professional at that time. Orphaned at the age of 22, he became an actor at Teatro Porvenir with Aurelio Tolentino and Macario Sakay. His favorite role was Bernardo Carpio, regarded as the savior of the Tagalog people. Proficient in the Tagalog language, he also read Spanish translations of books by Alexandre Dumas, Victor Hugo's Les Miserables, Las Ruinas de Palmyra about the French Revolution, biographies of U.S. Presidents, Jose Rizal's Noli Me Tangere and El Filibusterismo, the Bible, as well as medical and legal literature.

          <strong>Hulyo 3, 1892</strong>
           - Rizal established La Liga Filipina upon his return to the Philippines. The League aimed to unite the archipelago into one body, providing protection for all, defending against disorder and injustice, fostering the development of education, agriculture, and commerce, and studying and implementing reforms. Among its members were Andres Bonifacio, Deodato Arellano, and Apolinario Mabini.

        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>October 1892</strong>
           - Due to the slow process of the triangulo method in recruiting members, it was decided to discard it in favor of initiation. When the membership of the Katipunan reached one hundred, an election was held for the Supreme Council, and Deodato Arellano became the Supreme President (Supremo).

           - Tumungo si Andres Bonifacio at mga kasama sa Kweba ng Pamitinan, Bundok Tapusi, sa Montalban, tila sumusunod sa yapak ng maalamat na Tagapagligtas ng mga Tagalog, si Bernardo Carpio, at sinasabing isinigaw at isinulat sa mga pader ng kweba ng Makarok sa pamamagitan ng uling, “Naparito ang mga Anak ng Bayan, Hinahanap ang Kalayaan.  Mabuhay ang Kalayaan!”

           - The first and last edition of the Katipunan newspaper, Kalayaan, was published. From 300 members, the organization grew to an estimated 30,000 members. In the writings found here, such as Emilio Jacinto's Kartilya ng Katipunan and other Katipunan works, their concept of true freedom is evident—a freedom based on prosperity and a righteous and benevolent will. Likewise, the concept of a nation founded on unity, brotherhood, and love among the Tagalog (Taga-Ilog) people towards justice and enlightenment is apparent.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>July 21, 1896</strong>
           - Dr. Pio Valenzuela, a member of the Katipunan leadership, visited Rizal in Dapitan and informed him of the planned uprising. Valenzuela offered Rizal the position of President of the Katipunan, but Rizal declined. He advised that arms were needed, preparation should precede the uprising, assistance should be sought from the wealthy, and Antonio Luna should be appointed as a general.

        <h4 id="headlineofdeclaration">The revelation of the Katipunan and the First Cry of the Revolution</h4>
        <li>
          <strong>August 19, 1896</strong>
           - The Diario de Manila was raided, and the Katipunan was discovered after Teodoro Patiño reported the secret society to the parish priest of Tondo, Father Mariano Gil. Throughout the night, the Spanish authorities apprehended the suspected members.

        <li>
          <strong>August 24, 1896</strong>
           - 
           According to historians Guerrero, Encarnacion, and Villegas, the first cry of the Revolution occurred with the tearing of cedulas (the destruction of documents as a symbol of separation from Spain – Grito de Balintawak, in various locations mentioned in seemingly conflicting records – Balintawak, Kangkong, Bahay Toro, Pugad Lawin – the first three being places in Balintawak). According to Aurelio Tolentino, the true shout of Bonifacio in the "First Cry" was: "Freedom or slavery? Livelihood or death? Brothers: Let us face the guns and cannons to achieve our own freedom!" On that day, during a meeting in Tandang Sora's hut in Sitio Gulod, Barrio Banlat, Caloocan, the Revolutionary Government was established with Andres Bonifacio as its president. An agreement was also reached for the planned attack on Manila in the early hours of August 29-30, 1896.

           - In the early hours, Bonifacio led the attack on the Powder Depot in San Juan del Monte (now Pinaglabanan). Simultaneous assaults occurred throughout the entire province of Manila. The army from Cavite did not appear as agreed upon for the uprising. Governor-General Ramon Blanco placed eight provinces—Manila, Bulacan, Pampanga, Nueva Ecija, Tarlac, Laguna, Cavite, and Batangas—under Martial Law (symbolized by the eight rays of the sun on our flag).

          <strong>November 9-11, 1896</strong>
           - The success of Cavite against the Spaniards was evident in the Battle of Binakayan. The people of Cavite employed guerrilla warfare tactics in Zapote and Cavite Viejo under the supervision of engineer Edilberto Evangelista, who graduated from Ghent, Belgium. He met his demise in the Battle of Zapote on February 17, 1897.

           - As part of a series of executions related to the revolution, Rizal was shot in Bagumbayan. Bonifacio was in Cavite during that time, invited to mediate the conflicts among the factions of the Katipunan in the province—the Magdiwang, Magdalo, and Mapagtiis.
        </li>
        <h4 id="headlineofmilitaryagree">
          Convention of Tejeros, Pact of Tejeros, and Naic Military Agreement</h4>
        <li>
          <strong>March 22, 1897</strong>
           - On his birthday, Emilio Aguinaldo was elected in absentia as the president of the revolutionary government at the Convention at Casa Hacienda ng Tejeros. Diego Mojica warned Bonifacio that many ballots had been filled out even before the election, but Bonifacio dismissed the speculation. Bonifacio had previously agreed to replace the Katipunan as the government, convincing the convention that any decision made by the assembly would be respected. However, when Daniel Tirona opposed Bonifacio's election to the consolation position of Director of the Interior due to his lack of education and legal background, Bonifacio felt insulted. He pointed a gun at Tirona, invalidated the council's decisions as its chairman, and left.

          <strong>March 23, 1897</strong>

           - Meeting at Casa Hacienda ng Naic of Bonifacio's group. When Lazaro Makapagal informed them, Aguinaldo hurriedly arrived at the said meeting, and a confrontation between Aguinaldo's and Bonifacio's forces nearly occurred. Aguinaldo was surprised to find his two loyal generals, Mariano Noriel and Pio del Pilar, supporting the Supremo. The two generals returned to Aguinaldo and led the persecution against Bonifacio.
        </li>
        <h4 id="headlineexecution">Trial and Execution of Bonifacio</h4>
        <li>
          <strong>April 28, 1897</strong>
           - The wounded Andres and Procopio Bonifacio were arrested and taken to Naic. Ciriaco Bonifacio perished in the treacherous attack by their fellow countrymen in Limbon, Indang, led by Colonel Agapito Bonzon, who also attempted to assault the wife of the Supremo and the Lakambini of the Katipunan, Gregoria de Jesus. In Casa Hacienda ng Naic, the Supremo was confined in the jail cell under the stairs for three days, given only minimal and unmentionable food twice during that period.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>May 1, 1897</strong>
           - Upon the fall of Naic to the Spaniards, Aguinaldo and their captives moved to Maragondon, Cavite, where the trial of the Bonifacio brothers continued. The plan to rescue the Supremo by the group led by Diego Mojica was not realized.
